Problem Statement:
Predict a price range, indicating how high the price is, using K-Nearest Neighbors  algorithm.  

Outcome: 
Get a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each  other and how the EDA approach will help them gain more insights and knowledge  about the data that we have and classify the data into similar groups using KNN  algorithm.
