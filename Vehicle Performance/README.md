Vehicle Performance Prediction

Problem: Use regression analysis to predict vehicle performance (mileage i.e kilometre travelledper litre)

Outcome: Get a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each other and how the EDA approach will help them gain more insights and knowledge about the data that we have and train Linear Regression using SGD.
