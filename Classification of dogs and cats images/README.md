Classification of dogs and cats images

Problem Statement:
This project uses raw labelled  images of dogs and cats and trains the model using a convolutional neural network to  classify images dogs and cats. 

Outcome:
∙ Learn to load and prepare photos of dogs and cats (or any other binary  classification) for model building. 
∙ Develop a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch to build a binary  classification computer vision problem  
∙ A robust understanding of building any problem that involves binary classification  and computer vision. 
∙ Take new unseen images and pass it to the network and identify which of the two  classes the new image belongs to.
