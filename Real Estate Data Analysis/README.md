Real Estate Data Analysis

Abstract::
A key challenge for property sellers is to determine the sale price of the  property. The ability to predict the exact property value is beneficial for  property investors as well as for buyers to plan their finances according to  the price trend. The property prices depend on the number of features like  the property area, basement square footage, year built, number of  bedrooms, and others. The prices can be predicted more accurately if the  number of predictors is less. Several dimension reduction techniques are  being applied to decrease this number of predictors. 

Outcome: 
Get a better understanding of how to  compute principal components from scratch as well as using the sklearn  library. We should be able to implement PCA under exploratory data  analysis.
