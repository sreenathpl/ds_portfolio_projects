Predicting Breast Cancer in a patient

Problem Statement:
Given the details of cell nuclei taken from breast mass, predict whether or not a patient  has breast cancer using the Ensembling Techniques. Perform necessary exploratory  data analysis before building the model and evaluate the model based on performance  metrics other than model accuracy.

Outcome: 
Get a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each  other and build an SVM model. Apart from various performance measures, we will also  learn about hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation to improve these scores.
