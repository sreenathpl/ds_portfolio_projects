Vaccine Usage Prediction

Problem: Predict how likely it is that the people will take an H1N1 flu vaccine using Logistic Regression.

Outcome: Get a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each other and how the EDA approach will help them gain more insights and knowledge about the data that we have and train Logistic Regression using with MLE and SGD.
