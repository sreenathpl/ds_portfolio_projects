Taxi Fare Prediction

Problem Statement:
Given pickup and dropoff locations, the pickup timestamp, and the passenger count, the  objective is to predict the fare of the taxi ride using Random Forest. 

Outcome: 
Get a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each  other and how the EDA approach will help them gain more insights and knowledge  about the data that we have and train Random Forest model with the data. Also, we used  
GridSerachCV to get best hyperparameters to build optimized Random Forest model for  prediction.
